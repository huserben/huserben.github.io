title: Hosting your own 360° Feedback Session

Recently I felt a bit unsure about what value I'm providing to the organization and my peers. Time for getting some feedback, so I can inspect, adapt and hopefully find the sweetspot of what I like doing, what my peers expect and need from me and what helps the larger organization.  
A 360° Feedback session seemed like a good way to start, but the only experience I had with them so far was from about a year ago when I filled in a survey with questions that I did not think of as helpful at all. I wanted to have something more personal and more engaging.
The following post describes what I ended up doing and how it worked for me and the participants.

# What to Focus on?
As mentioned above I was less interested in a review of performance, but more into what others think is valuable and what not so much.
While researching a bit I stumbled over Jeff Gothelfs blog post where he describes the [Japanese idea of ikigai](https://jeffgothelf.com/blog/ikigai-a-formula-for-successful-agile-team-leadership/).

Ideally I end up smack in the middle, doing something that I love and I am good at, the world (or the company) needs and I also still get a salary.
The main goal of the feedback session would be to have people help me figure out two of those things: tell me what they most need from me so I can prioritize where to focus on and help me understand my strengths and weaknesses.  

# Synchronous or Asynchronous?
Now that I know what to get feedback on I was wondering how to get this. The above mentioned survey was certainly not what I had in mind. I wanted people to be able to speak their mind and be candid with me. I think that works best [in person](https://www.radicalcandor.com/in-person-feedback/) - this means having a virtual meeting with my peers. Given that we are still in a pandemic and the people involved live in various different countries and even continents, that's the closest we can get to in person.

# Enter Liberating Structures
The virtual setup brings along the question of how to engage with people. Should I just schedule 15-20 individual meetings and talk one on one with everybody? Or try to have a single session with everyone? Knowing [the surprising power of Liberating Structures](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21481308-the-surprising-power-of-liberating-structures?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=51el1ALRFP&rank=1), even when working with larger groups in a virtual setup, I opted for the single meeting approach. That way the participants can discuss together. They can hear various different perspectives (which is why we're doing the 360 degrees in the first place) and build on each others inputs.

## Ecocycle Planning
I chose to use [Ecocycle Planning](https://medium.com/the-liberators/create-focus-with-ecocycle-planning-7d86c4b8b799) in order to get people to think about four different areas to give me feedback for:  

- In what areas should I invest in my growth? What am I not yet doing that you would like to get from me?
- What am I just starting to touch the surface? What am I doing but not yet to the extent that you can fully benefit from it?
- Where do you see my most beneficial contributions at the moment?
- What do you think should I stop doing to free up my time for other things?

The idea was to run the ecocycle with a [1-2-4-All](https://medium.com/the-liberators/use-1-2-4-all-to-tap-into-the-collective-brainpower-of-a-group-of-any-size-6cf60ac7a818) structure. First let people think of items and place them on their own Ecocycle. After this pair them up and let them discover patterns that emerge and build on their individual ideas. After that create pairs of pairs and see what really stands out. At the end quickly go through the ecocycles and let each group pitch what they came up with.
