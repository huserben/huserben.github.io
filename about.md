Hi I'm Benji

![Awesome Profile Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/about/beard_profile.png)

I live in Zurich, Switzerland and am a Software Developer.  

At work I'm a Scrum Master that finds joy in helping individuals and teams reach their full potential.  
At home I like to code whenever I find the time (check out my [github](https://github.com/huserben) for more info).  

Everything that can be automated should also be automated, for example an [IKEA desk](https://github.com/huserben/idasen-rest-bridge) or my private cookbook that is hosted on [github](https://github.com/huserben/cookbook) and via Github Actions [published to the internet](https://huserben.github.io/cookbook/) on every push.

As you can see in the profile pic above, I'm also extremely talented with MS Paint ðŸ§”
